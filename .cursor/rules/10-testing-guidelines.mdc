# Testing Guidelines

Usertour uses various testing approaches to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Test Types

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and components in isolation
- Focus on verifying specific behaviors and edge cases
- Use mocks for external dependencies

### Integration Tests
- Test interactions between different components
- Verify that different parts of the system work together
- Use realistic test data

### End-to-End Tests
- Automated tests that simulate real user behavior
- Use Cypress for browser-based testing
- Cover critical user flows

## Testing Best Practices

### Component Testing
- Test component rendering
- Test component interactions
- Verify prop handling and state changes
- Test error states and edge cases

### API Testing
- Test endpoint behaviors
- Verify request validation
- Test error handling
- Check authorization logic

### Test Organization
- Group tests logically by feature/component
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Keep tests independent and atomic

### Testing Tools
- Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Cypress for end-to-end tests
- Test utilities from React Testing Library
