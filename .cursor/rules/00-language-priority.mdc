# CRITICAL: English Code Requirements

## Mandatory English Usage for Code

- **ALL code comments MUST be written in English**
- **ALL variable names, function names, class names, and other identifiers MUST use English words**
- **ALL documentation (READMEs, API docs, inline documentation) MUST be in English**
- **ALL Git commit messages MUST be in English**

This is an absolute requirement and takes precedence over all other language guidelines. While user-facing communication may be in Chinese, all code-related content must be in English to maintain consistency and compatibility with development tools.

## Code Comment Format

- Comments should be concise and explain "why" rather than "what"
- Use proper grammar and punctuation in comments
- Keep comments up-to-date when code changes
- Document complex logic, edge cases, and important implementation details
- Use JSDoc style comments for functions and classes in JavaScript/TypeScript

## Naming Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are universally understood
- Follow project-specific naming patterns for consistency
- Choose names that make code self-documenting

## Chinese for User Communication

- Use Chinese for all user-facing communication
- Maintain a professional tone in Chinese content
- English technical terms may be used when necessary in technical discussions
- Ensure clarity and accuracy in translations

## Commit Message Standards

- Write in present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Start with a type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep messages concise but descriptive
- Format: `type(scope): short description`
- Example: `feat(auth): implement JWT authentication`
